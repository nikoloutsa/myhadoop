        <value>DFS_REPLICATION</value>
        <description>HDFS is partly designed to allow storage failures and uses
            replication for this. Since either your data on myhadoop jobs is only 
            supposed to live through a single run or you can use persistent data
            that will most likely run on solid hardware it is quite save to keep
            replication at 1 and reduce the IO overhead.

        <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node
            should store the name table.  If this is a comma-delimited list
            of directories then the name table is replicated in all of the
            directories, for redundancy. </description>

        <description>Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node
            should store its blocks.  If this is a comma-delimited
            list of directories, then data will be stored in all named
            directories, typically on different devices.
            Directories that do not exist are ignored.

        <description>The HDFS block size defines the size of the parts in which
